Cython is an optimising static compiler for both the Python programming language and the extended Cython programming language (based on Pyrex).

It makes writing C extensions for Python as easy as Python itself

To see introduction : https://cython.org/

To start running the code you should:

step 1.  download cython (in verion2). example in linux : sudo apt-get install cython

step 2.  perpare your .pyx file, in here is SDFT.pyx

step 3.  perpare setup.py file and do in linux : sudo python setup.py build_ext --inplace

Then you will have created .c and .so file, that python can import the file and the functions(cpdef or def) in it.

So,

step 4.  do in linux : sudo python start.py

To change parameters, simply modify start.py file.
